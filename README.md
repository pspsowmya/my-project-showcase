# üìù My Project Showcase

Welcome to my project showcase.

Here are the highlights of my most notable projects.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Test Data Management And Modernization (TDMM)

The purpose of TDMM is to facilitate a user to create, search and publish test data present in different environments from one place. 
End users should be able to use a portal as an interface to create synthetic data, to search test data and to publish data from one environment to another.

  ### Technologies/Tools  used: 
  Angular5, Java, SpringMVC, MySQL database, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, SVN, Jenkins, SonarQube

  ### Responsibilities:
  1. Involved in design discussions and understanding of business requirements and identifying the relevant functional and technical requirements.
  2. Developed wireframes for the UI screens using Microsoft Visio 
  3. Implemented the application user interface using Angular5
  4. Used SVN for version control and Jenkins for continuous build and deployment
  5. Used Visual Studio Code for coding and developing the application.
  6. Involved in unit testing of the application using Karma and Jasmine and utilised SonarQube for code coverage metrics and ensuring a healthy coverage of tests.
  7. Involved in creating, modifying SQL queries, prepared statements and stored procedures used by the application.
  8. Created a technical design document explaining all the stages of the development life cycle. 
  9. Followed AGILE (SCRUM) methodologies, had sprint planning every two weeks and involved in daily meetings to monitor the status.
  10.Responsible for all technical and application related issues by research and proper resolution.

  ### Skills Gained: 
  * Have learnt front end technologies like Angular to implement UI screens and integrated with a backend Java application.
  * Got experience in using Microsoft Visio for creating wireframes.
  * Gained hands-on experience in using the SVN-version control tool and Jenkins.
  * Learnt how to write unit tests in Angular and check test coverage using SonarQube.
  * Gained an overall knowledge of front end development and unit testing.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Movie API Project

The aim of the project is to create a movie API which helps a user to get movie recommendations based on input criteria such as year, genre, title, ratings, 
certification, release date etc. Users should be able register and login to the application and make a request to receive data based on their query.
Once the data is ready, a notification is sent to the user's contact number through an SMS. 

  ### Technologies/Tools used:
  Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JUnit, Mockito, Intellij, Git version control, RESTful web services, AWS

  ### Responsibilities:
  1. Created backend handlers and HTTP endpoints for movies, users and admin resources using Spring Boot. 
  2. Used Spring security features to implement security for the application such that the endpoints are restricted based on user roles.
  3. Implemented authorization using JWT token to authorise the users who are sending the requests. 
  4. Used Bcrypt Password encoder for encrypting the passwords that are being saved and retrieved from the database.
  5. Followed a Test-Driven Development approach by writing unit tests for each functionality first and then implemented the code. 
  6. Used Mockito for testing the database and web services functionality.
  7. Worked on getting data from an external API like TMDB and created a database script to insert the data into MySQL database.
  8. Worked on connecting to the MySQL database and persisting user data to the database. 
  9. Used SpringBoot actuator to monitor the health of the application. 
  10.Used an external API, Twilio API to send a notification SMS to the user who has requested for the data.
  11.Created frontend screens for user registration and login and integrated it with the backend Java application.
  12.Used git as a version control tool for committing and reviewing the code. 
  13.Used AWS service elastic beanstalk to deploy the web application. 

  ### Skills gained: 
  * Able to gain a good knowledge on Spring Boot and create an API using RESTful web services.
  * Used MVC architecture by separating the controller logic in controllers,  business logic in the service layer, database connectivity in the model layer and View in the           front-end screens.
  * Able to gain knowledge on some of the important Spring Boot components such as Spring Boot actuator and Spring security for checking the health of the application and           enhancing the application with security respectively. 
  * Worked on consuming some external movie APIs such as TMDB and persisting the data retrieved to the application specific database. 
  * Able to gain knowledge on deploying the web application to cloud services such as AWS.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Mars Rover Project

The main aim of this project is to move rovers around the Surface of Mars. The surface of Mars is represented by a Square Plateau. The Plateau is divided into a grid. 
Different vehicles in space like rovers move on this grid. The rover can spin to left / right or move a step forward or backward in different directions, North, West, 
East and South based on the user instruction. The final output should be the position where the rover has reached after passing through different positions based on the instructions provided by the user.

  ### Technologies and Tools Used: 
  Java,  Intellij, JUnit, Git version control

  ### Responsibilities:
  1. Created a UML class diagram to design the classes and interfaces that are used in the application.
  2. Used OOPs concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces in the application for separation of concerns. 
  3. Implemented logic for navigation of a rover based on user instructions and returning a final position. 
  4. Implemented unit test cases for different scenarios considering both positive and negative test cases.
  5. Considered edge cases such as rover collisions and implemented logic for covering edge cases. 
  6. Designed the project such that it can be extended to support vehicles other than rovers and different shaped plateaus in future. 

  ### Skills gained: 
  * Able to understand and implement OOP concepts like Encapsulation,Inheritance, Abstraction and Interfaces. 
  * Gained knowledge on designing the UML class diagram to come up with classes and interfaces that can be used before starting the implementation. 
  * Able to gain knowledge on writing unit test cases by considering different scenarios.
